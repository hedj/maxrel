A relativistic N-body code.

# Bad
 - It is very young and almost certainly has lurking bugs.
 - It also has a lot of room for optimization.

# Good
 - It comes with code for computing E and B fields of coils and polywells
 - It comes with tests
 - It computes properly relativistic and time-delayed fields.
